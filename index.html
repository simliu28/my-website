		<h2>Context</h2>
		<p>From 2008 to 2019, I was breathing Shanghai’s air. At the beginning, it wasn’t that easy to switch environments which were very different. Step by step, thanks to some events that happened in my life, I learned a lot. My experience in China definitely changed my life.</p>

	<div id="city" class="card">
		<h2>The city</h2>
		<p>Shanghai is the biggest city of China, with a population of 25 million of people. The city is characterized by a cultural mix: the old town and the new city. Hanging out in Shanghai is just like travelling through time. You can stand on one street with old housings, walk 5 minutes and stand in front of a skyscraper.</p>

	<div id="school" class="card">
		<h2>The school</h2>
		<p>I studied in the French School of Shanghai for 11 years. It was a unique experience since we were in excellent learning conditions (15 students per class, good infrastructure…). I had the opportunity to practice basketball for 4 years and play piano in the orchestra for 6 years.</p>
	</div>

	<div id="pros" class="card">
		<h2>The pros of going to Shanghaï</h2>
		<p>Whether to go live there, or just for holidays, you will definitely enjoy your trip in Shanghai. At first, the prices are cheaper. Everything is easier, since you can pay with your phone everywhere. There are plenty of famous and traditional places to visit (such as temples, old streets…) as well as new buildings that can reach the sky (Shanghai Tower, Shanghai World Financial Center…).</p>
